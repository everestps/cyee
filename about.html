          <h2> About the Author </h2>
          <h3> Who am I, exactly? </h3>
          
          <p> I am Christopher Yee, a senior at Everest, and due to graduate high school in 2015. I have lived in California my entire life, and currently live in San Carlos. I have worked with computer science for about four years now, having started learning to code in freshman year. Last year in particular, I honed my skills with Java and learned how to organize and annotate my programs to make them easier to read. In college, I plan to major in computer science, though I would also be interested in pursuing cognitive science in the colleges that offer it. I do want to attend a liberal arts school, however, both for a more diverse education and student body and in case I find I want to pursue an alternate major. </p>
		  
		  <p> Long before I got into programming, though, I was a fan of novels. Stories have always captivated me, and especially those well told or well constructed. Unfortunately for me, my taste in books tends toward the fantasy genre, and well written fantasy books are difficult to find. As I did find some, though, I branched out more into literature; progressing in school also helped this along, as I was exposed to the more complex classics. Now, my primary requirement for books is that they be well written, rather than have an interesting setting. When I do choose fantasy books, though, I prefer magic realism to traditional high fantasy, as I feel it makes for better thematic and sociopolitical relation. More recently, this passion for reading has led me to experiment somewhat with creative writing. </p>
		  
		  <p> One of my favorite books is <em> The Name of the Wind</em>, by Patrick Rothfuss. I have read many books, but this novel in particular used a fusion of classic literary elements and magic realism that drew my attention. </p>
